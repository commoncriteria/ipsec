  <sec:Overview>
	Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a suite of open standards for ensuring private
	communications over public networks. It is typically used to encrypt Internet Protocol (IP) traffic 
	between hosts in a network and to create a virtual private network (VPN). 
	A VPN is a virtual network built on top of existing physical networks that provides a secure 
	communications mechanism for data and control information transmitted between computers or networks. 
	IPsec can also be used as a component that provides security for other
	internet protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). 
	<h:br/><h:br/> 
	The main components of IPsec are Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE).
	ESP is the protocol used to to transport encrypted and integrity-protected 
	communications across the network.  IKE is the protocol used to set up and manage IPsec connections.
	<h:br/><h:br/>
	This <h:i>Functional Package for IPsec</h:i> provides a collection of requirements and evaluation activities for
	IPsec implementations. The intent of this package is to provide PP, cPP, and PP-Module authors with a readily
	consumable collection of SFRs and EAs to be integrated into their documents. This Package can be used to 
	to evaluate the IPsec functionality of TOEs that are not themselves VPN clients. For example,
	it could be used to evaluate the trusted channel functionality of an operating system that chooses to 
	use IPsec rather than SSH or TLS to implement secure remote management. And of course, this Package 
	can be used to encapsulate the IPsec-specific requirements in a VPN technology evaluation.
	<h:br/><h:br/>
	As such, this Package attempts to specify only requirements and evaluation activities for IPsec implementations
	as distinct from those for VPN implementations, such as VPN gateways and clients.

<!-- 1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation	-->
<!--			-->
    <sec:toes title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation">
		The Target of Evaluation (TOE) in this Functional Package (FP) is an IT product that includes 
		an implementation of IPsec.  Typically this is a VPN client or VPN gateway - for which IPsec 
		functionality is fundamental. But the TOE could also be an operating system or other
		IT product for which IPsec functionality is ancillary. This FP describes the security 
		functionality of IPsec in terms of <xref g="CC"/>. 
		<h:br/><h:br/>
		The contents of this FP must be appropriately incorporated into a PP, cPP, or PP-Module. When this Package 
		is so incorporated, the ST must include selection-based requirements in accordance with the selections or 
		assignments indicated in the incorporating document.<h:br/><h:br/>
		An ST must identify the applicable version of the PP, cPP, or PP-Module and this
		Functional Package in its conformance claims.<h:br/><h:br/>
		The PP, cPP, or PP-Module that incorporates this Package must typically include the following components in order
		to satisfy dependencies of this Package. It is the responsibility of the PP, cPP, or PP-Module author who 
		incorporates this FP to ensure that dependence on these components is satisfied, either by the TOE or by 
		assumptions about its Operational Environment.<h:br/><h:br/>
	    	Note that IKE defines its own key derivation function in <xref to="bibRFC7296"/> (approved 
	    	by NIST in <xref to="bibNIST800135r1"/>). As a result, this Package does not require that  
	    	the incorporating document claim a key derivation SFR (typically FCS_CKM_EXT.5 or FCS_CKM.5).

				<title>The TSF shall implement IPsec as specified in <xref to="bibRFC4301"/>.</title>
				<note role="application">
					<xref to="bibRFC4301"/> calls for an IPsec implementation to protect IP traffic through the use
					of a Security Policy Database (SPD). The SPD is used to define how IP packets are
					to be handled: PROTECT the packet (e.g., encrypt the packet), BYPASS the IPsec
					services (e.g., no encryption), or DISCARD the packet (e.g., drop the packet). The
					SPD can be implemented in various ways, including router access control lists,
					firewall rulesets, a "traditional" SPD, etc. Regardless of the implementation
					details, there is a notion of a "rule" that a packet is "matched" against and a
					resulting action that takes place.<h:br/><h:br/>
					While there must be a means to order the rules, a general approach to ordering
					is not mandated, as long as the TOE can distinguish the IP packets and apply the
					rules accordingly. There may be multiple SPDs (one for each network interface)
					but this is not required.<h:br/><h:br/>
					It is permissible for the TSF to receive configuration of IPsec behavior from an environmental
					source. For example, The SPD is established and populated through an administrative interface or
					application implemented by the entity that establishes the IPsec connection, such as a VPN gateway 
					or client application. This interface or application is outside the scope of this FP.<h:br/><h:br/>

					<TSS>
						If the TOE boundary includes a general-purpose operating system or mobile device, the evaluator
						shall examine the TSS to ensure that it describes whether the IPsec functionality is 
						architecturally integrated with the TOE itself or whether it is a separate executable that 
						is bundled with the TOE.<h:br/>
					</TSS>
					<Guidance>
						The evaluator shall ensure that the operational guidance contains any appropriate information for ensuring
						that the IPsec implementation can be properly configured.<h:br/>
					</Guidance>
					<Tests>
						As a prerequisite for performing the Test EAs for the individual FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1 elements below, the
						evaluator must do the following:<h:br/>
						The evaluator must create a test environment consisting of at least the components illustrated
						below. It is expected that the traffic generator will be used to construct network packets and will provide the
						evaluator with the ability manipulate fields in the ICMP, IPv4, IPv6, UDP, and TCP packet headers. The
						evaluator shall provide justification for any differences in the test environment.<h:br/>
						<figure entity="images/network.png" title="Test Environment" id="fig-testenv"/>
						Note that the evaluator shall perform all tests using the TOE and a representative sample of
						platforms listed in the ST (for TOEs that claim to support multiple platforms).<h:br/>
					</Tests>
				</aactivity>
				<aactivity level="element"> <!-- The TSF shall implement IPsec as specified in RFC 4301 -->
					<TSS>
						The evaluator shall examine the TSS and determine that it describes how the IPsec functionality is
						implemented.<h:br/><h:br/>
						The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS identifies any platform functionality the TSF relies upon to support
						its IPsec implementation, if any (e.g. does it invoke cryptographic primitive functions from the platform’s 
						cryptographic library, enforcement of packet routing decisions by low-level network drivers).<h:br/><h:br/>
						The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the IPsec implementation interacts
						with the network stack of the platforms on which it can run (e.g., does the client insert itself within the
						stack via kernel modifications, does the IPsec implementation simply invoke APIs to gain access to network services).<h:br/><h:br/>		   
						The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the SPD is implemented and the rules for processing
						both inbound and outbound packets in terms of the IPsec policy. The TSS describes the rules that are
						available and the resulting actions available after matching a rule. The TSS describes how the available
						rules and actions form the SPD using terms defined in <xref to="bibRFC4301"/> such as BYPASS (e.g., no encryption),
						DISCARD (e.g., drop the packet), and PROTECT (e.g., encrypt the packet).			  
						As noted in section 4.4.1 of <xref to="bibRFC4301"/>, the processing of entries in the SPD is non-trivial and the evaluator
						shall determine that the description in the TSS is sufficient to determine which rules will be applied given
						the rule structure implemented by the TOE. For example, if the TOE allows specification of ranges,
						conditional rules, etc., the evaluator shall determine that the description of rule processing (for both
						inbound and outbound packets) is sufficient to determine the action that will be applied, especially in the
						case where two different rules may apply. This description shall cover both the initial packets (that is, no
						SA is established on the interface or for that particular packet) as well as packets that are part of an
						established SA. <h:br/>
					</TSS>    
					<Guidance>
						The evaluator shall examine the operational guidance to verify that it describes how the SPD is created and
						configured. If there is an administrative interface to the IPsec implementation, then the guidance describes how the
						administrator specifies rules for processing a packet. The description includes all three cases - a rule that
						ensures packets are encrypted/decrypted, dropped, and allowing a packet to flow in plaintext. The
						evaluator shall determine that the description in the operational guidance is consistent with the
						description in the TSS, and that the level of detail in the operational guidance is sufficient to allow the
						administrator to set up the SPD in an unambiguous fashion. This includes a discussion of how ordering of
						rules impacts the processing of an IP packet.<h:br/><h:br/>
						If the IPsec implementation is configured by an external application, such as a VPN gateway, then the operational
						guidance should indicate this and provide a description of how IPsec is configured by the external
						application. The description should contain information as to how the SPD is established and set up in an
						unambiguous fashion. The description should also include what is configurable via the external
						application, how ordering of entries may be expressed, as well as the impacts that ordering of entries may
						have on the packet processing.<h:br/><h:br/>
						In either case, the evaluator ensures the description provided In the TSS is consistent with the capabilities
						and description provided in the operational guidance.<h:br/>
					</Guidance>
					<Tests>
						Depending on the implementation, the evaluator may be required to use a VPN gateway or some form of
						application to configure the client. For Test 2, the evaluator is required to choose an application that
						allows for the configuration of the full set of capabilities of the IPsec implementation. 
						For example, if the IPsec implementation supports specification of wildcards, subnets, etc., it is unacceptable 
						for the evaluator to specify only a single fully qualified IP address in the rule.<h:br/><h:br/>
						The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
						<testlist>
							<test>The evaluator shall configure an SPD that is capable of the following: dropping a
								packet, encrypting a packet, and allowing a packet to flow in plaintext. The selectors used in the
								construction of the rule shall be different such that the evaluator can generate a packet and send packets
								to the IPsec endpoint with the appropriate fields (fields that are used by the rule - e.g., the IP addresses, TCP/UDP
								ports) in the packet header. The evaluator performs both positive and negative test cases for each type
								of rule. The evaluator observes via the audit trail, and packet captures that the TOE exhibited the expected
								behavior: appropriate packets were dropped, allowed through without modification, were encrypted by
								the IPsec implementation.
							</test>
							<test>The evaluator shall devise several tests that cover a variety of scenarios for packet processing.
								These scenarios must exercise the range of possibilities for SPD entries and processing modes as outlined
								in the TSS and operational guidance. Potential areas to cover include rules with overlapping ranges and
								conflicting entries, inbound and outbound packets, and packets that establish SAs as well as packets that
								belong to established SAs. The evaluator shall verify, via the audit trail and packet captures, for each
								scenario that the expected behavior is exhibited, and is consistent with both the TSS and the operational
								guidance.

					The ST author is afforded a selection based on the version of IKE in their

					As far as SA lifetimes are concerned, the TOE can limit the lifetime based on the
					number of bytes transmitted, or the number of packets transmitted. Either
					packet-based or volume-based SA lifetimes are acceptable; the ST author makes
					the appropriate selection to indicate which type of lifetime limits are supported.<h:br/><h:br/>
					The ST author chooses either the IKEv1 requirements or IKEv2 requirements (or
					both, depending on the selection in FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.5. The IKEv1 requirement
					can be accomplished either by providing Authorized Administrator-configurable
					lifetimes (with appropriate instructions in documents mandated by AGD_OPE),
					or by “hard coding” the limits in the implementation. For IKEv2, there are no
					hard-coded limits, but in this case it is required that an administrator be able to
					configure the values. In general, instructions for setting the parameters of the
					implementation, including lifetime of the SAs, should be included in the 
					operational guidance generated for AGD_OPE. It is appropriate to refine the
					requirement in terms of number of MB/KB instead of number of packets, as long
					as the TOE is capable of setting a limit on the amount of traffic that is protected
					by the same key (the total volume of all IPsec traffic protected by that key).<h:br/><h:br/>
					If the TOE is a VPN, then if a length of time is used for configuring SA lifetimes,

					<Tests>
						When testing this functionality, the evaluator needs to ensure that both IPsec endpoints are configured
						appropriately. From the RFC: “A difference between IKEv1 and IKEv2 is that in IKEv1 SA lifetimes were
						negotiated. In IKEv2, each end of the SA is responsible for enforcing its own lifetime policy on the SA and
						rekeying the SA when necessary. If the two ends have different lifetime policies, the end with the shorter
						lifetime will end up always being the one to request the rekeying. If the two ends have the same lifetime
						policies, it is possible that both will initiate a rekeying at the same time (which will result in redundant
						SAs). To reduce the probability of this happening, the timing of rekeying requests SHOULD be jittered.”<h:br/><h:br/>

					<xref to="bibRFC8247"/> limits IKEv2 ECDSA authentication to "ECDSA with SHA-256 on the P-256 curve,"
					"ECDSA with SHA-384 on the P-384 curve," and "ECDSA with SHA-512 on the P-521 curve."
					A more agile digital signature scheme for IKEv2 authentication is defined in <xref to="bibRFC7427"/>.
					This Package requires only that RSA- or ECDSA-based digital signatures be used.<h:br/><h:br/>
					This Package does not permit use of Shared Key Message Integrity Code for peer authentication, 
					although support is mandatory in the standard.<h:br/><h:br/>
					This Package requires that digital signature-based peer authentication use X.509v3 certificates
					to verify the identity of the keys used in the signatures.<h:br/><h:br/>
					Peer authentication using certificates must be accomplished using mechanisms inherent in 
					the IKE protocol. Authentication using pre-shared keys can be accomplished
					using methods specified in the IKE protocol, transmission through EAP, or through an out-of-band sharing mechanism.<h:br/><h:br/> 
					If either "<h:i>Pre-shared keys as specified in FIA_PSK_EXT.1...</h:i>" selection is made, then 
					the external requirement <no-link>FIA_PSK_EXT.1</no-link> must be claimed. FIA_PSK_EXT.1 includes options
					for MFA solutions.<h:br/><h:br/>
					If "<h:i>Pre-shared keys as specified in FIA_PSK_EXT.1 transmitted via EAP as specified in FCS_IPSEC_EXT.2,</h:i>" is selected, 
					then FCS_IPSEC_EXT.2 must be claimed in addition to <no-link>FIA_PSK_EXT.1</no-link>. 
					"<h:i>means other than EAP</h:i>" refers either to native IKE protocol mechanisms or to out-of-band mechanisms.<h:br/><h:br/>

					</Guidance>
					<Tests>
						The following tests shall be repeated for each certificate-based peer authentication method supported:
						<testlist>
							<test>The evaluator shall have the TOE generate a public-private key pair, and submit a CSR (Certificate
								Signing Request) to a CA (trusted by both the TOE and the peer VPN used to establish a connection) for
								its signature. The values for the DN (Common Name, Organization, Organizational Unit, and Country) will
								also be passed in the request. Alternatively, the evaluator may import to the TOE a previously generated
								private key and corresponding certificate.
							</test>
							<test>The evaluator shall configure the TOE to use a private key and associated certificate signed by a
								trusted CA and shall establish an IPsec connection with the peer.                
							</test>
							<test>The evaluator shall test that the TOE can properly handle revoked certificates – conditional on
								whether CRL or OCSP is selected in <no-link>FIA_X509_EXT.1</no-link>; if both are selected, and then a test 
								is performed for each method. The evaluator shall ensure that a
								valid certificate is used, and that the SA is established. The evaluator then attempts the test with a
								certificate that will be revoked (for each method chosen in the selection) to ensure when the certificate
								is no longer valid that the TOE will not establish an SA
							</test>
							<test>[conditional] For each selection made, the evaluator shall verify factors are required, as indicated in the
								operational guidance, to establish an IPsec connection with the server. 
							</test>
							For each supported identifier type (excluding DNs), the evaluator shall repeat the following tests:
							<test>For each field of the certificate supported for comparison, the evaluator shall configure the peer’s
								reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to match the field in the peer’s
								presented certificate and shall verify that the IKE authentication succeeds.
							</test>
							<test>For each field of the certificate support for comparison, the evaluator shall configure the peer’s
								reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to not match the field in the peer’s
								presented certificate and shall verify that the IKE authentication fails.
							</test>
							The following tests are conditional:
							<test>[conditional] If, according to the TSS, the TOE supports both Common Name and SAN certificate
								fields and uses the preferred logic outlined in the Application Note, the tests above with the Common
								Name field shall be performed using peer certificates with no SAN extension. Additionally, the evaluator
								shall configure the peer’s reference identifier on the TOE to not match the SAN in the peer’s presented
								certificate but to match the Common Name in the peer’s presented certificate, and verify that the IKE
								authentication fails.
							</test>
							<test>[conditional] If the TOE supports DN identifier types, the evaluator shall configure the peer's
								reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to match the subject DN in the peer's
								presented certificate and shall verify that the IKE authentication succeeds. To demonstrate a bit-wise
								comparison of the DN, the evaluator shall change a single bit in the DN (preferably, in an Object Identifier
								(OID) in the DN) and verify that the IKE authentication fails. <h:b>To demonstrate a comparison of DN values,
								the evaluator shall change any one of the four DN values and verify that the IKE authentication fails.</h:b>
							</test>
							<test>[conditional] If the TOE supports both IPv4 and IPv6 and supports IP address identifier types, the
								evaluator must repeat test 1 and 2 with both IPv4 address identifiers and IPv6 identifiers. Additionally,
								the evaluator shall verify that the TOE verifies that the IP header matches the identifiers by setting the
								presented identifiers and the reference identifier with the same IP address that differs from the actual IP
								address of the peer in the IP headers and verifying that the IKE authentication fails.
							</test>
							<test>[conditional] If, according to the TSS, the TOE performs comparisons between the peer’s ID
								payload and the peer’s certificate, the evaluator shall repeat the following test for each combination of
								supported identifier types and supported certificate fields (as above). The evaluator shall configure the
								peer to present a different ID payload than the field in the peer’s presented certificate and verify that the

					entity attempting to establish a connection.
				</title>
				<note role="application">
					The reference identifier is the identifier the TOE expects to receive from the peer
					during IKE peer authentication. The presented identifier is the identifier that is contained
					within the peer certificate body. The TOE must support at least one of the following
					identifier types: IP address,
					Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), user FQDN, or Distinguished Name (DN).
					In the future, the TOE will be required to support all of these identifier types. The
					TOE is expected to support as many IP address formats (IPv4 and IPv6) as IP
					versions supported by the TOE in general. The ST author may assign additional
					supported identifier types in the second selection.<h:br/><h:br/>
					At this time, only the comparison between the presented identifier in the peer’s
					certificate and the peer’s reference identifier is mandated by the testing below.
					However, in the future, this requirement will address two aspects of the peer
					certificate validation: 1) comparison of the peer’s ID payload to the peer’s
					certificate which are both presented identifiers, as required by RFC 4945 and 2)
					verification that the peer identified by the ID payload and the certificate is the
					peer expected by the TOE (per the reference identifier). At that time, the TOE will
					be required to demonstrate both aspects (i.e. that the TOE enforces that the
					peer’s ID payload matches the peer’s certificate which both match configured
					peer reference identifiers).<h:br/><h:br/>
					Excluding the DN identifier type (which is necessarily the Subject DN in the peer
					certificate), the TOE may support the identifier in either the Common Name or
					Subject Alternative Name (SAN) or both. If both are supported, the preferred
					logic is to compare the reference identifier to a presented SAN, and only if the
					peer’s certificate does not contain a SAN, to fall back to a comparison against
					the Common Name. In the future, the TOE will be required to compare the
					reference identifier to the presented identifier in the SAN only, ignoring the
					Common Name.
